You are given an integer , you have to convert it into a string.

Please complete the partially completed code in the editor. If your code successfully converts  into a string  the code will print "Good job". Otherwise it will print "Wrong answer".

 can range between  to  inclusive.

Sample Input 0

100
Sample Output 0

Good job

============================================================

import java.util.*;
import java.security.*;
public class Solution {
 public static void main(String[] args) {

  DoNotTerminate.forbidExit();

  try {
   Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
   int n = in .nextInt();
   in.close();
   //String s=???; Complete this line below

   //Write your code here
   String s = ""+n;

   
   if (n == Integer.parseInt(s)) {
    System.out.println("Good job");
   } else {
    System.out.println("Wrong answer.");
   }
  } catch (DoNotTerminate.ExitTrappedException e) {
   System.out.println("Unsuccessful Termination!!");
  }
 }
}

//The following class will prevent you from terminating the code using exit(0)!
class DoNotTerminate {

 public static class ExitTrappedException extends SecurityException {

  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1;
 }

 public static void forbidExit() {
  final SecurityManager securityManager = new SecurityManager() {
   @Override
   public void checkPermission(Permission permission) {
    if (permission.getName().contains("exitVM")) {
     throw new ExitTrappedException();
    }
   }
  };
  System.setSecurityManager(securityManager);
 }
}

Here are 3 ways to convert an int to a String

String s = String.valueOf(n);

String s = Integer.toString(n);

String s = "" + n;

=================================================================

I understand what you did for the first and second method. But can you please explain what does 3rd method do. In other words, how does "" convert integer into string? 

We know that "" is of type String. It is known as the empty string. It is a String with no characters in it. The + operator, when used on the right side of a String, simply connects stuff to the right of the original String. If what it's connecting is not yet a String, it automatically converts it into one, which is what we want for this exercise.

"" + "Hello" + "there."
becomes the String "Hello there." and

"" + n
becomes the String n, where n was automatically converted into a String for us.
